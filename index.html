								<!-- <p>Safety of students and staff. For COVID-19, I support the mitigation measures (masks) that have been put in place, and would encourage the district to work closely with Public Health officials to educate all participants in the district of the availability, safety, and efficacy of vaccination.</p> -->
								<ul>
									<li>Ensuring a safe learning environment for all students and staff</li>
									<li>Supporting a curriculum based on facts as prescribed by the State Department of Education</li>
									<li>Ensuring our District is doing all it can with finite resources to attract and retain talented staff</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									With the rise of political polarity and divisiveness reaching all the way to school boards, Tim will engage constructively with his fellow board members and residents of the community 
									even when there may be others that strongly disagree with him. Tim understands who the primary stakeholders are - the students. Coupled with that is the clear understanding of the role and
									authority of the school board. <br/><br/>
									With these important factors in mind, Tim will ensure the correct decisions are being made for the right people. Tim knows that it is wrong
									to divert precious time debating issues that we have nominal control over, which ultimately comes at the expense of the students. For issues within our purview, he will work to make sure we have received complete input from the community and try his best to understand how a fellow Board member, or member of the community, has come to his or her point of view.

									<br/><br/>
									<bold>CRT "Critical Race Theory" - Issue or Non-Issue</bold> <br/>
									Tim feels that the research over the past 40 years makes it clear that systemic racism did not end with the Civil Rights movement in the 60s. With the guidance of a well laid out curriculum it is something that should be taught. Tim believes that the strategic framework and four-way equity test appear to be good guidelines for shaping a curriclulum. To monitor the effectiveness of this, Tim will encourage constant engagement with members of underserved communities to ensure that over time we can work through these issues better. <br/><br/>

									Tim supports an evolving, vetted curriculum that reflects new perspectives, insights, and discoveries. This involves discussion of racism in our society. He does not view it as a mechanism for placing blame, but rather a means to have a better understanding of historical causes and how racism can be overcome.

						<!-- Accomplishments -->
							<article id="accomplishments">
								<h2 class="major">Accolades</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/awards.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Being Chair of the MIT Annual Fund Board. A Board has the responsibility to set policy, but Staff needs to execute for the benefit of the stakeholders, in this case the students and parents. During my tenure I found positive results come by working in concert with staff, applauding their successes and encouraging new ideas and challenging old ones. This can be done while still holding the Administration to high standards, respectfully listening to the concerns of parents, and being wise stewards of the resources provided by the community.</p>
